# Scalability

When projects are small, quality issues in regards to code architecture, testing and CI/CD only have a small impact as you can always fall back to doing things manually. This is not a possibility with larger projects. For example, in larger projects if you use manual testing to complete your regression testing then you end up with the [regression death spiral](https://scottlee.netlify.app/posts/regression-death-spiral). Put simply this means that as more feature work is done, more time is required for regression. This leads to the teamâ€™s velocity getting suffocated as they find themselves needing to do more and more manual testing as the project grows. Similar ideas also apply to code readability and the quality of your CI/CD operations. Poor quality in any of these areas leads to greater pain as your project size grows.
